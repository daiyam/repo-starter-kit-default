Users are not allowed to create Issues directly

Users are not allowed to create Issues directly in this repository - we ask that you create a [Discussion] first.

This project **does not use the issue tracker for discussion or feature requests**. Instead, we use GitHub [discussions] for that. Once a discussion reaches a point where a well-understood, actionable item is identified, it is moved to the issue tracker. **This pattern makes it easier for maintainers or contributors to find issues to work on since every issue is ready to be worked on**.

Any Discussion which clearly identifies a problem and can be confirmed or reproduced will be converted to an Issue by a maintainer, so as a user finding a valid problem you don't do any extra work anyway. Thank you.

For more details, see our [CONTRIBUTING.md].
