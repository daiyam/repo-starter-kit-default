title: "[READ ME FIRST]: Discussion Rules"
---

Welcome!

This is where users ask questions, propose suggestions, resolve their issues and connect with other members of our community.

There are 7 channels:

- [Announcements]. Updates from maintainers. Only maintainers can post here. Highly moderated.
- [Feature Requests, Ideas]. Share ideas for new features and discuss how they should be implemented.
- [Issue Triage]. Report existing features that aren't working as expected.
- [Questions & Answers]. Ask the community for help. Please search for issue tracker and previously asked questions before asking.
- [General]. Chat about anything and everything here. Connect with others.

Please make sure you understand and agree to these rules before posting, which are simplified in the interest of your time:

1. Be respectful; do not use hate speech or harass other users.

2. Any form of spamming, trolling, flaming is not allowed.

3. Keep things friendly.

4. If you have the same issue or agree with a feature proposal, **please click the "upvote" button or react with an emoji instead of adding a new comment**.

5. Do not revive old posts ("necroposting"), especially ones that have already been resolved. Posts that have been necroposted on may be locked.

6. Users play a part in issue reproduction and developing feature requests. Team members could not always replicate the exact circumstances that led to an issue — just saying "it doesn't work" and leaving helps no one.

7. Please take a few minutes to read our [Contributing guidelines](../blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

8. Follow our [Code of Conduct](../blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
